# Cuna Mutual Code Challenge
This application was made for the code challenge for Cuna Mutual.  The details of the challenge are in `docs/challenge.md`, with some emphasis added for my own benefit.  I translated those requirements into a checklist (`docs/checklist.md`) to help me keep track of work, and wrote out some of my initial thought process and planning in the `design.md` file as well.

This project was bootstrapped using `create-react-app`, as it provides the simplest and cleanest way to get a front-end application up and running.  As such, it is extremely simple to build & run.  See the below sections for instructions
## Instructions
### Run application in local development
`yarn start`
### Build application
`yarn build`
